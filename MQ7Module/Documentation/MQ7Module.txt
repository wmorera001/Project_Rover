Description
-Main chip: LM393, MQ-7 gas sensor.
-Operating voltage: DC 3-5V.
-with the signal output indication.
-the dual signal output (analog output, and TTL level output).
-TTL output valid signal is low level, can connected to microcontroller directly.
-0 ~ 5V analog output voltage, the higher concentration the higher voltage.
-with high sensitivity and good selectivity for CO.
-with a long service life and reliable stability.
-rapid response and recovery characteristics.
